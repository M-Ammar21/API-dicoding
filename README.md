# Course and Jobs Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project, developed by Team C241-DR02, aims to enhance the user experience on the Dicoding platform by creating a recommendation system for courses and jobs. The system uses a combination of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend suitable courses and job openings to users.

## Project Proposal

### Problem Statement

**Problem Code:** [C24-DR] How Dicoding Recommends a Course or Job Opening for Users

### Objective

To improve user experience by recommending suitable courses based on users' competencies, education, and professional background.

### Proposed Solution

Our solution involves using a content-based recommendation system with Count Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity, and a collaborative filtering recommendation system with TensorFlow Recommenders. The course recommendation system suggests courses based on the ones the user has taken, while the job recommendation system recommends jobs based on keywords extracted from the user's uploaded CV.

## Project Plan

### Executive Summary

The project aims to build a content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation system for recommending courses and jobs on the Dicoding platform. This will help users, especially newcomers, find relevant courses and job opportunities by suggesting courses based on the user's course history and jobs based on keywords extracted from the user's CV.

### Project Scope & Deliverables

1. Build a model for job recommendations based on user CVs and profiles.
2. Build a content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation system for courses.
3. Create an API to recommend courses for new users and jobs for existing users.
4. Conduct testing and validation of the recommendation models.

### Project Schedule

A Gantt chart outlining the project schedule is provided, with flexibility for adjustments based on circumstances.

### Risks and Issues

- Ensuring data confidentiality and proper data handling.
- Validating input data to prevent errors or mispredictions.
